# VibesDeGoGo! Reference: Hook Rules

This file documents the behavior implemented by the hooks.

## Common Guards

Sidecar files are protected. Edit/Write tools targeting any path matching:

```text
.claude/.vdgg-*
```

are blocked outright. Bash commands are split into shell segments (on `&&`, `||`,
`;`, `|`, newline) and each segment that mentions a sidecar path is checked with
a **whitelist** (fail-closed): the segment is allowed only if it is a `git commit`
(whose message may mention a sidecar path without writing it) or a genuine read —
a leading read-only verb (`cat`, `grep`, `test`, `ls`, `head`, `tail`, …) with no
output redirection or `tee`. A redirection to `/dev/null` writes nothing and so
does not count (`2>/dev/null` silences stderr rather than writing the sidecar);
it is stripped before the check rather than exempting the segment, so a segment
that both silences stderr and writes still shows its `>` and stays denied. Only
`/dev/null` is stripped here — the entry gate's carve-out also covers
`/dev/stdout` and `/dev/stderr`, which is unsafe for this guard: the pattern has
no terminator, so `>/dev/stdout/<sidecar>` would be swallowed whole, and on
Linux `/dev/stdout` is `/proc/self/fd/1`, which `1<.` in the same segment makes
resolve inside the repository. Every other form — interpreters (`python`,
`perl`), `dd`, `install`, `truncate`, other redirects, file ops — is denied.
Segmenting means a `git commit` cannot shield a sidecar-mutating segment in
the same command line.

This covers state files, the active marker, and the simplify/review sentinels —
so the review gate cannot be satisfied by forging a sentinel. Use `vdgg_state_*`
helpers instead. The same write protection also applies to `.vdgg-target`
(reads stay allowed), so the agent cannot self-author `REVIEW_COMMAND` to forge
a passing review.

## Phase Behavior

| phase | Step | Edit/Write | Bash | Agent |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| no state | none | allow (deny when `VDGG_REQUIRED=on`) | allow (deny writes/commits when `VDGG_REQUIRED=on`) | allow |
| `declare` | 1 | only `tasks/vdgg/{id}/` | allow except state writes | block |
| `requirements` | 2 | only `tasks/vdgg/{id}/` | require `requirements.md` before Step 3 | block |
| `investigating` | 3 | only `tasks/vdgg/{id}/` | allow except state writes | allow |
| `planning` | 4 | only `tasks/vdgg/{id}/` | allow except state writes | allow |
| `task-selected` | 5 | block | allow except state writes | allow |
| `implementing` | 6 | only task-allowlisted files (task notes exempt) | block commits and test commands | allow |
| `testing` | 7 | only task-allowlisted files (task notes exempt) | block commits, direct testing to implementing, and verified without review gate + task gate | allow |
| `reflection` | 6-R | only `progress.md` and `investigation-r*.md` | block direct verified and require updated retry docs before implementing | allow |
| `verified` | 7 end | block | allow except state writes | allow |
| `progress` | 8 | only `progress.md` and configured version files | allow except state writes | allow |
| `commit` | 9 | only `progress.md` and configured version files | allow commit; block base branch commit/push in branch-pr | allow |

## Entry Gate (VDGG_REQUIRED)

While no session is armed (no `.claude/.vdgg-active`, empty id, or missing
state file), the hooks are normally fail-open. When the repository's
`.vdgg-target` sets `VDGG_REQUIRED=on` (the literal value `on` only), the
PreToolUse hook instead denies, until `vdgg_state_init` arms a session:

- `Edit` / `Write` / `NotebookEdit` on any path (including `.vdgg-target`
  itself, so the gate cannot be self-disabled),
- unknown tools that expose a `file_path` / `notebook_path` (fail-closed),
- Bash segments that write files: redirects to real paths (`>` / `>>`;
  redirects to `/dev/null`, `/dev/stdout`, `/dev/stderr` and fd dups like
  `2>&1` are exempt), `tee`, a leading mutating verb (`rm`, `mv`, `cp`, `dd`,
  `install`, `truncate`, `touch`, `ln`, `patch`, `mkfifo`), `sed`/`perl`
  with `-i`, or `git commit`.

Read-only tools, `Agent` (a subagent's own tool calls pass through this same
hook), builds/tests, and the arming command itself stay allowed. Without jq
the hook cannot classify tools, so it fails closed while the key is `on`
(only jq installation commands pass). Absent/`off`/other values keep the
historical fail-open behavior, so repositories that never opted in are
untouched.

Rationale: arming the gates must not be a voluntary act. An agent that
ignores the workflow contract (observed 2026-07-05: a model invoked the
skill, never ran `vdgg_state_init`, and committed directly) would otherwise
keep every guard dormant. The deny message points to Step 1.

## Error Recognition

PostToolUse detects Bash failures and writes:

```text
.claude/.vdgg-error-pending
```

The next Bash command must contain the marker in its command text (e.g. in a
leading comment), the same contract as the Codex edition:

```text
[Error Acknowledged]
```

The agent should briefly state what failed and what it will do next.

Search commands such as `rg`, `grep`, `find`, `sed`, `awk`, `jq`, `test`, and `[` are treated specially: exit code 1 is allowed as "no matches".

## Review Gate (simplify or explicit review)

During `testing`, successful verification must be followed by a review pass.
Two sentinels can satisfy the gate:

```text
.claude/.vdgg-simplify-sentinel-{vdgg_id}-{loop_count}   created by PostToolUse when the simplify skill runs
.claude/.vdgg-review-sentinel-{vdgg_id}-{loop_count}     created by vdgg_review_run when the review command exits 0
```

Fields (both sentinels):

```text
started=1
started_at=<UTC timestamp>
modified=0|1
modified_files=<comma-separated paths>
```

Verified transition behavior:

- no sentinel present: block verified transition,
- `modified=0`: allow verified transition and delete the sentinels,
- `modified=1`: block verified transition and require reflection plus re-test.

PostToolUse flips `modified=1` on whichever sentinel exists when Edit/Write
touches implementation files during `testing` (sidecar and `tasks/vdgg/` paths
are excluded). Sentinels cannot be written directly; see Common Guards.

## Known Limits

- The Stop hook depends on Claude Code providing `cwd` and `transcript_path` in hook JSON. If Claude Code changes that contract, the Stop hook may become a no-op rather than a blocker.
- The reflection gate compares whole-second file mtimes; if `progress.md` or `investigation-r*.md` is written in the same second as the state transition, the return to implementing can be blocked once — retrying a moment later succeeds.
- The sidecar write guard matches the literal `.claude/.vdgg-` path in the Bash command text. A segment that hides the path behind a shell variable or command substitution (e.g. `D=.claude; rm -f "$D/.vdgg-active"`) can evade the match. The hook raises the cost of forgery but is a guardrail, not a security boundary; it does not sandbox a determined agent.
- The read whitelist is a leading-verb model, so read-only forms it does not name are denied: `sed -n '1,5p' <sidecar>`, `awk '{print}' <sidecar>`, and `for f in <sidecar>*; do …; done` are all blocked. `sed` and `awk` are left out deliberately (`sed -i`, and awk's `print > "file"`, write); `for` is extracted as the leading verb but is not on the list. The denial message names representative allowed verbs, so read such a file with `cat`/`head`/`grep` instead.
- The redirect test looks for a redirect operator in the same segment, not at where the redirect points. A read that redirects its output to an ordinary file is therefore denied (`cat <sidecar> > /tmp/copy`), while the same read piped onward is allowed (`cat <sidecar> | tee /tmp/copy`), because the pipe starts a new segment that no longer mentions the sidecar. Neither form writes the sidecar; `cat x | tee <sidecar>` is still denied, since `tee` is not on the read list. Carving out more redirect targets is not the fix — see the `/dev/null` note under Common Guards.
- The entry gate's Bash write detection shares the same literal-match limits: interpreter one-liners (`python -c "open('f','w')"`), writes hidden behind shell variables, `>|` (noclobber overwrite, split away with `|` during segmenting), and a bare trailing `>` left at a segment end are not detected. It stops contract-ignoring drift (the observed failure mode), not a deliberately evasive agent.
